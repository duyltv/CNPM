/*
 * GUI functions

 */
 
- You have to complete these GUI functions by PHP and HTML.
- Remember that these are FUNCTIONS that shown in webpage,
so you don't have to write header, footer, or templates
for your function. Template will be implemented later.

- Example: Read "status.html" file, you only have to write:
	> include("status.html");

- Espeacially with upload function, you have to write content
of files.php (root folder) that make you can download files
across this file.

- Result: You can write many files in your folder(s), but
there must be one file, which has the same name with the 
folder + ".php", run your function.
